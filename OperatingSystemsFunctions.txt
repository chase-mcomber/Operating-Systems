Managing Memory - 
One of the functions of an operating system is to manage the primary memory and main memory of a system. The OS will accomplish this by keeping track of the primary memory, and designate which bytes are used for which programs. There are many bytes in the system, and keeping them all organized is no easy task!

File Management - 
Another function of the operating system is to organize the local files on your system's storage. The OS will keep track of where information is stored, including projects, program files, and user data. Files can even be grouped together to organize them even further, providing quick access to important documents.

Input/Output Management - 
The operating system manages all inputs and outputs on the device. Keyboards, mice, peripheral devices, USBs and more are all inputs that the OS is responsible for managing and ensuring that they run effectively on the system. The data that is returned by these input devices will go through the operating system to achieve the desired output, including display, audio, launching programs, and data retreival.
